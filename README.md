# Hello and welcome to my GitHub!

My name is Bianca, I'm from São Paulo and at the age of 17 I moved to Botucatu/SP, where I graduated in Veterinary Medicine and completed a residency in anesthesiology at Unesp. Upon returning to São Paulo, I completed a postgraduate program in intensive care and, after seven years of work in the field, I made the decision to transition my career to the technology industry in order to combine my passion for problem-solving with creating something that positively impacts people's lives in a universal and accessible way.
